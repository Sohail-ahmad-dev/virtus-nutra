                    <h3>Text Message Program Details</h3>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra offers subscription text message programs (also known as subscription SMS programs). Visitors to ForceFactor.com may enroll in these programs in a variety of ways; for example, by texting a specific keyword to a mobile short code, or by filling out and submitting a form on ForceFactor.com. New methods are added regularly. No matter how you enroll, you always have the ability to opt out of these types of programs. <strong>Message frequency varies.</strong></p>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra also offers one-time text messages. For these one-time text messages, you will not be enrolled in any subscription text message program (unless you separately opt in to one or more such programs). Individuals may text a keyword (e.g., HEALTH, WELL, HEART, etc.) to one of our short codes and receive one-time information on a certain topic.</p>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra is committed to building user trust and confidence by promoting and complying with the use of business practices that help protect the privacy of our visitors and customers and their data. For more information, you can view a copy of our privacy policy by <a href="privacy.html">clicking here</a>. Virtus Nutra does not sell mobile opt-in lists.</p>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra does not charge you separately for any of our subscription text message programs or one-time text messages (we do charge for Virtus Nutra products, the costs of which are functionally separate from our text message programs). However, <strong>message and data rates may apply</strong> from your mobile carrier. Subject to the terms and conditions of your mobile carrier, you may receive text messages sent to your mobile phone. Participation in Virtus Nutra text message programs are standard rated (no premium content).</p>
                    <p>By providing your consent to participate in our text message programs, you approve any such charges from your mobile carrier. Charges for text messages may appear on your mobile phone bill or be deducted from your prepaid balance. Virtus Nutra reserves the right to terminate its text message services, in whole or in part, at any time without notice. The information in any message may be subject to certain time lags and/or delays. You are responsible for managing the types of text messages you receive. If you have any questions or need help, text <strong>HELP</strong> to any one of our short codes, email sms@forcefactor.com, or call 1-855-602-6678.</p>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra also occasionally runs contests and sweepstakes via our text message programs. Note that mobile carriers are not liable for delayed or undelivered messages.</p>
                    <p><strong>To stop receiving text messages from Virtus Nutra, text STOP to one of our short codes. By enrolling in one of our subscription text message programs, you consent that following such a request to opt out, you will receive one (1) final message from Virtus Nutra confirming that you have been deactivated in our system. Following this confirmation message, no additional text messages will be sent for the particular program in question unless you reactivate your subscription.</strong></p>
                    <p>Virtus Nutra may use an automatic dialing system to deliver text messages to you. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines an "automatic telephone dialing system" (or “autodialer�?) as equipment that has the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, and to call such numbers (47 C.F.R. § 64.1200). By your enrollment in either or both of our subscription text message programs and one-time text messages, you give your consent to Virtus Nutra to use an automatic dialing system to deliver text messages to the telephone or mobile phone number to which you have directed Virtus Nutra to transmit these text messages.</p>
